description: "A design lens for adding, changing, or reviewing a mechanism (rule / skill / hook / agent / workflow / runtime extension / prompt chain) in an agent environment: it asks which of 6 layers (model capability / skill = procedural memory / values & policy / eval / data & memory / runtime) the mechanism belongs to, why it cannot be left to the model itself, whether the next model generation will make it unnecessary, and whether it is worth keeping when the runtime is swapped (Claude Code → Pi → Codex), and returns Keep / Move / Simplify / Make temporary / Delete / Defer. Use when — \"should this go in the harness?\", \"which layer does this belong in?\", \"can't the model handle this itself?\", \"will this survive a runtime change?\", \"the harness is bloated\", \"can I add this hook / rule / workflow?\", when implementation-chain's Plan judges a task to change the harness itself (rules / skills / hooks / agents / settings in ~/.claude), or /harness-boundary. Delete / Simplify count as success. NOT for — a standalone build-or-not decision on something not yet built (→ agent architect), periodic audits of installed assets and Retire / Dissolve verdicts (→ rules-stocktake / skill-stocktake / agent-stocktake; this skill only passes evidence), bulk cross-checks at a model generation change (→ generation-audit), validity of loop structure (→ loop-design-check)."

# harness-boundary — a design lens that treats as assets only what survives discarding the harness

"The harness is the asset" is only half right. Harness logic that compensates for model-specific weaknesses
goes stale with each model generation, and the runtime (tool execution, permissions, state, retry, agent loop)
is being standardized and replaced. What remains are **other layers mixed into** the harness. This skill
raises the questions for separating that mixture when a mechanism is added, changed, or reviewed.

This is not an enforced architecture but a lens for judging asset boundaries, portability, and obsolescence.

## Core principles

- Put model capability in the model. Do not reimplement it in the harness
- Put procedural knowledge in skills
- Keep values and responsibility boundaries explicit and inspectable
- Put the definition of quality in evals
- Put domain knowledge and history in data / memory
- Keep the runtime as thin and swappable as practically possible

And: **do not optimize to preserve the harness. Optimize to preserve what should survive
swapping the harness.** When a new model makes existing logic unnecessary, that is not a design
failure but the moment to delete. Delete / Simplify count as success.

## The 6 layers

| Layer | Contents | Counterpart in this harness | Existing vocabulary |
|---|---|---|---|
| Model capability | reasoning / planning / coding / tool-use judgment / self-correction / decomposition / reflection | Claude itself (including the system prompt + tool descriptions) | substrate, generation-audit's runtime layer |
| Skills (procedural memory) | this task follows this procedure / this review uses these angles / this failure has this runbook / this deliverable gets this verification | `skills/*/SKILL.md`, the body of `agents/*.md` | "procedures go in skills" (rules/README.md) |
| Values / Policies / responsibility boundaries | what to prioritize / what not to do / operations that need human approval / scope of delegation / source of truth / priorities on failure | `rules/common/` (identity / values layer, ADR-0018 D7), permissions in `settings.json`, authority in the task request | "environment-specific facts, wiring, traps" (ADR-0035) |
| Evals | acceptance criteria / tests / rubric / benchmark / regression / quality gate | `.claude/verify.sh`, `tests/`, `skill-comply`, `llm-as-judge`, judge agents (readme-judge, etc.) | Verify, binding judgment |
| Data / Memory | deliverables / decision history / domain knowledge / preferences / provenance / historical state | `docs/adr/`, auto-memory, `.notes/`, `metrics/*.jsonl`, wiki | ADR = dated hypothesis |
| Runtime | tool calling / shell & fs / permission implementation / sandbox / connector / retry / logging / state / routing / agent loop | Claude Code itself, `hooks/*.sh`, MCP servers, the Workflow / Agent tools, launchd tick | control plane (ADR-0019), hooks are timing (ADR-0035) |

Hooks sit in the runtime layer, but they **easily encode policy silently** (e.g., the conditions of an approval gate,
what to block). When looking at a hook, separate "the timing wiring" from "the policy embedded in it," and
ask whether the latter is visibly stated in a rule / ADR.

## The 6 questions

For each target, use only the questions its scale calls for.

- **A. Which layer is it?** If it spans several, can it be separated?
- **B. Why can't it be left to the model itself?** If you cannot state a clear reason, do not add it to the harness.
  "The previous model was bad at this" is not a reason — have you tried it with the current model?
- **C. Is the next model generation likely to make it unnecessary?** If it is a workaround for a capability gap, do not make it
  permanent architecture. Mark it explicitly as temporary / removable and write its expiry condition
- **D. Is it worth keeping when the runtime is swapped?** If it is still needed after moving Claude Code → Pi → Codex → an unknown
  runtime, it is a candidate to hold separately from the runtime. If not, keep it thin as runtime-specific
- **E. Is it necessary infrastructure or a differentiating asset?** Both are "important," but do not conflate them. Infrastructure is
  assumed to be borrowed and replaced; differentiating assets are held in portable form
- **F. Can it move to a simpler layer?** Typical moves:
  custom agent loop → model / hard-coded workflow → skill / conditional branching inside the runtime → policy /
  prompt-based quality judgment → eval / embedded knowledge → data

## Targets to suspect strongly

Not rejected automatically. But the following go through B–D without skipping:

elaborate agent loops / mandatory reflection / mandatory planning stages / fixed multi-agent
orchestration / excessive routing / long system prompts / model-specific behavioral workarounds /
duplicate implementations of model capability / workflows that remain because an old model needed them / runtime-specific
abstractions that contain domain knowledge / hooks that silently encode policy / opaque automation that hides responsibility boundaries /
mechanisms whose purpose is preserving the existing harness design itself

## Output

Do not overdo it. If one line is enough, use one line (e.g., "This is the skill layer. No reason to put it in the runtime → Move").
**Do not output every field every time.** Only when the judgment is contested or the impact is broad, use this form:

```
Classification        : layer (a separation proposal if several)
Keep outside model because : reason to keep it outside the model (if none, a Delete candidate)
Portability           : whether to keep it when the runtime / model is swapped
Obsolescence risk     : Low / Medium / High (1-line rationale, expiry condition if possible)
Recommendation        : Keep / Move / Simplify / Make temporary / Delete / Defer
```

## Connecting to existing verdicts

This skill issues a Recommendation directly only for **mechanisms being proposed or changed**.
When applied retroactively to **installed assets**, do not execute the conclusion yourself; pass it as evidence to the relevant stocktake
(the same "read, never require" contract as generation-audit. Do not split the source of truth for the verdict table — ADR-0022).

| This skill | Counterpart for installed assets |
|---|---|
| Delete | Retire / Dissolve in rules / skill / agent-stocktake |
| Move | Demote / Merge in the same, or rules-distill (skill → rule direction) |
| Simplify | Improve in the same, built-in `/simplify` |
| Make temporary | write a deadline in `review-when:` for a rule, `## Review-when` for an ADR, `## Expiry conditions` for a skill |
| Defer | skill: file it as a `draft` with `rfc-writer` (in a small repo with a single table, one line in `.notes/TASKS.md`) |
| Keep | leave a 1-line reason (it becomes grounds for future stocktakes) |

## Out of scope

- A standalone build-or-not decision on something not yet built → agent `architect` (zero-base test). This skill answers "if it is built,
  in which layer and until when"
- Validity of loop structure (servo / decidability / damping) → skill: `loop-design-check`
- Bulk cross-check at a model generation change → skill: `generation-audit`
- Human portability (whether others can install and use it) → `skill-creator/references/portability.md`

## Expiry conditions

- When the substrate natively handles judgments about layer decomposition, portability, and obsolescence, and asks them on its own when
  the harness changes, this skill retires (Downward, `rules/common/akc-cycle.md`)
- If the 6-layer division itself breaks down (e.g., eval is absorbed into model capability, the boundary between skill and data
  disappears), rewrite the division. Questions A–F are expected to outlive the division
- If this skill exceeds 150 lines, apply the 6 questions to this skill itself
